Raw yeast data with 48 biological replicates:
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4878611/
    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB5348 (FASTQ files)
    https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/2194841 (sample map)
    
    Use map to determine which FASTQ files to download.  There are 7 technical
    replicates for each of 48 biological replicatesand 2 conditions.  For
    starters I used the first tech rep of the first 14 bio reps of each
    condition.

Mann-Whitney p-value:
    Apparently wrong z-score formula:
