.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--output\fR file.txt
Report fold-change and P-values to file.txt instead of the default stdout.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.B fasda fold-change
computes fold-change and P-values for two or more conditions.  The input
is two or more tab-separated values (TSV) files containing normalized
counts for all conditions.  These files are generally produced by
.B fasda normalize.

Currently, the Mann-Whitney U-test (A.K.A. Wilcoxon rank sum test) is used
to compute P-value and this requires a minimum of 8 replicates per condition
to achieve reasonable statistical power.  Future versions may include
parametric tests that can provide power with fewer replicates, and the
expense of high FDR (false discovery rate).
