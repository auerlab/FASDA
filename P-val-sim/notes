OFC = observed fold-change
Event A = mean of N fold-changes >= OFC
Event B = null hypothesis is true
Null hypothesis (Wilcoxon): P(count2 > count1) = P(count2 < count1)

P-value = P(A|B) = P(A ^ B) / P(B)

Solution:

S1 = { All pairs (count m, count n) : m != n }
S2 = { Means of all subsets of N fold-changes from S1 }

For S2:

    MFC = mean of 1 subset of N fold-changes

	   |{ MFC >= OFC }|
    P(A) = ----------------
		 |S2|
    P(B) = 1
    P(A ^ B) = P(A)
    P(A|B) = P(A ^ B) / P(B)
	   = P(A) / 1
	   = P(A)
