FC = observed fold-change
Event A = count1 / count2 >= FC
Event B = null hypothesis is true
Null hypothesis (Wilcoxon): P(count2 > count1) = P(count2 < count1)

P-value = P(A|B) = P(A ^ B) / P(B)

Solution:

S = { All pairs (count m, count n) : m != n }

For S:

    P(A) = |{ (count1, count2) : count1 / count2 >= FC }|
	   ----------------------------------------------
			       |S|
    P(B) = 1
    P(A ^ B) = P(A)
    P(A|B) = P(A ^ B) / P(B)
	   = P(A) / 1
	   = P(A)
