Event A = count2 / count1 >= observed fold-change FC
Event B = null hypothesis is true

P-value = P(A|B) = P(A ^ B) / P(B)

Null hypothesis (Wilcoxon):

P(count2 > count1) = P(count2 < count1)

Solution:

Generate set X = all possible pairs of separate counts from pooled samples,
i.e. all pairs (count m, count n) : m != n.

P(B) = 1
P(A ^ B) = P(A)
P(A|B) = P(A) = (# pairs where count2 / count1 >= FC) / (# pairs)
