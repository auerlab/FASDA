P-values
    Paul:
	EdgeR, etc. very sophisticated
	Rank sum test almost as good
	Could be especially useful for large studies with many samples
	where R packages become too cumbersome
	R function wilcox.test()
	    Some cases not as sensitive
	    Some cases more robust

    Paper:
	Wilcoxon test is the only method that controls FDR consistently
	Wilcoxon has almost no power for sample sizes < 8
	    Need a parametric test?
	    Better power than most other methods for SS > 8
